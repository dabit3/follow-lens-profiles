## Follow an array of profiles on Lens Protocol

This script takes an array of profiles and follows everyone.

Will soon update with a Twitter API call to read addresses from responses to a tweet, to make it easier for people to follow those who respond when people ask "drop your lens".

Also the script will probably be useful to just aggregate addresses for allow-lists, etc..
